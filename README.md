## Getting Started

```bash
composer require amranich/ajax-dispatcher:v1.0.0-beta3
```

You can copy/paste this code snippet for a quick start.

We're using Guzzle PSR-7 interface implementation here, but you can use any other library you like as long as it implements the same interface.

```php
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use AmraniCh\AjaxDispatcher\Dispatcher;
use AmraniCh\AjaxDispatcher\Handler\Handler;
use AmraniCh\AjaxDispatcher\PSR7ResponseSender;
use AmraniCh\AjaxDispatcher\Router\Router;
use GuzzleHttp\Psr7\Response;
use GuzzleHttp\Psr7\ServerRequest;

try {
    $request = ServerRequest::fromGlobals();
    
    $router = new Router($request, 'handler', [
    
        // ?handler=hello&name=john
        Handler::get('hello', function ($params) {
            $response = new Response();
            $response->getBody()->write("hello " . $params["name"]);
            return $response;
        }),
    ]);

    $dispatcher = new Dispatcher($router);

    $dispatcher
        ->cleanBuffer()
        ->dispatch()
        ->stop();
        
} catch (\Exception $ex) {
    $response = new Response(
        $ex->getCode() ?: 500, 
        ['Content-type' => 'application/json'], 
        json_encode(['message' => $ex->getMessage()])
    );

    $sender = new PSR7ResponseSender($response);
    $sender->send();
    exit();
}
```

## Usage

### Route to controller/class method

If you like to put the business logic in a separate class or in a controller, you can route your requests to them like this :

```php
Handler::get('getProfile', [UserManager::class, 'getProfile']),
```

Or :

```php
Handler::get('getProfile', 'UserManager@getProfile')
```

But you have after to register the controller namespace/instance in the router, like this :

```php
$router->registerControllers([
    UserManager::class,
]);
```

If the controller/class has some dependencies that must be passed within the constructor, you can still instantiate the
controller on yourself :

```php
$router->registerControllers([
    new UserManager($dependencyOne, $dependencyTwo)
]);
```

### Catch handlers exceptions

*I want to catch exceptions that only occurs from my AJAX handlers, and not those thrown by the library or somewhere else, how I can
do that ?*

Answer :

```php
$dispatcher->onException(function (\Exception $ex) {
    // $ex exception thrown by a handler
});
```

### Clean output buffer before calling requests handlers (Recommended)

To be sure that the response (output) for the ajax request it comes only from the defined handlers, and prevent
unexpected echos from sending their content earlier to the browser use the `cleanBuffer` method :

```php
$dispatcher
    ->cleanBuffer()
    ->dispatch();
```

### Exit the script after dispatching the request (Recommended)

Use `stop()` to tell the dispatcher to exit the script right after the handler execution, this can be useful to ensure that the response (output)
generated by your handlers will not be altered or modified after :

```php
$dispatcher
    ->dispatch()
    ->stop();
```

## Background

The idea of the library came to my mind a long time ago when I was mostly developing web applications using just plain
PHP, some of these applications were performing a lot of AJAX requests into a single PHP file, that file can have a hundred
lines of code that process these requests depending on a function/method name that send along with the request,
so I started to think of ways to clean up this file to improve the readability and maintainability of the code.
